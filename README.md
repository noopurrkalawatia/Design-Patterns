# Design-Patterns

This repository contains very basic programs to understand the design patters. 

### 1. Factory Design Patterns : 


Sailent features :
1. Type : Creational Pattern
2. Features : Create the object using an interface, in such a way that we abstract the process of creating the object from the
              user. Clients will use the same interface in order to create the objects. 
              Use a static method in order to create the instances of the object. 
              Gives rise to code that doesnt have tight coupling.
3. Example : Library and client APIs.
